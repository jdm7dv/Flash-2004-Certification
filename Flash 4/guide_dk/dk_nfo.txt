the guide dk is made up of 14 .fla's and one .swf
the .fla's include...
alert
ambient1
ambient2
ambient3
ambient4
ambient5
attention
entrance
exit
greeting
minimize
response
restore 
static

the only .swf is the testingtool.

you have 47 or less frames to put each animation.
once you have finished a few, make sure the swfs
are in the same directory and use the testing tool
to test the animations...
be careful not to delete any actions or your guide 
wont work.  once you are done with all the animations, 
place them in a directory accessable via the internet.  
Type the path to that directory in the GuidePath field 
of the preferences menu and you should be ready to go.

for any questions you have (other than qustions about the source code)
