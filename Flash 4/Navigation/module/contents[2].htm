I used Gopher to         do school research and to download weather maps from Japan, to see what         the weather was like where I used to live.</font></p>      <p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">You         lived in Japan?</font></b><br>        Yes, for seven years. I was a teenager. It was cool&#151;was a good experience         to grow up in a different culture, learning a different language and seeing         a different approach to life. I was actually a Unix system administrator         in Japan for a year, after I graduated from high school. They had a Unix         network system that was all HP machines, and all the manuals were in English.         They needed somebody who could read English, use the manuals, and learn         to run the system. </font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>So when did you         get involved with the web?</b></font><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>        I guess my interest in the Internet grew initially from my technical background.         As soon as Mosaic came out, I was intrigued to see how I could meld that         with my design interests, which I was following in school. I was a graphic         design major, studying traditional print design. </font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>So how did you         bridge the gap between print and Web design? </b></font><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>        My interest in pursuing the Web as a platform for design spawned from         my frustration with the process in print design, and with prepress. When         I was studying print design, I worked a lot with prepress. I did imaging,         and I worked in print shops on the actual press. I did that consciously,         to get an overview of the whole design process&#151;so that when I became         a designer, I would have an edge over other designers by knowing how to         smooth that process.</font></p>      <p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> But in the         midst of that, I just saw how frustrating the whole thing was. As a designer,         I felt my job was finished as soon as I had a design I was happy with         in Photoshop and Quark. The appeal of the Web was that it was actually         finished, almost, at that point, except for formatting the HTML. </font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Except for formatting         the HTML?</b></font><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>        That barrier was what led me to learn HTML. I learned most of my HTML         from using the view source tool, and from early online guides. That was         the beauty of the Web&#151;that I could learn it without having to buy books         or go to school for it.</font></p>      <p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Another hook         for me was that before a lot of people knew about the Web&#151;when AOL         and CompuServe were becoming big companies&#151;no one really knew what         the Internet was. I felt strongly that there was a big future for this         new platform and was determined to help further it's growth. </font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Definitely... and         how did you start working in the field?</b></font><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>        I was consulting for a real estate agent on backend systems for a while,         and I convinced them that they needed a Web site. Theirs became one of         the first real estate agencies on the Web. They didn't understand why         they needed a Web site, but since then, they've gotten a lot of their         business from their Web site, and they've thanked me over and over.</font></p>      <p><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Soon after         that I started getting into animation as well - I was an addict as soon         as I saw the betas of Netscape 2, which allowed animated GIFs, and early         Shockwave blew me away. At that point people were just making movies with         their 3D logo spinning around but I knew that the living, interactive         Web was something I wanted to be involved with.</font></p>      <B><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"       size=2><BR>      </FONT></B>       <P>       <P>       <P>       <table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">        <tr>           <td>&nbsp; </td>          <td align="right">             <table border="0" width="49" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">              <tr>                 <td><a href="jeremy2.html" onMouseOut="MM_swapImgRestore()" onMouseOver="MM_swapImage('document.next_arrow','document.next_arrow','/software/dreamweaver/designerspotlight/techniques/images/next_over.gif','#906526502500')"><img border="0" src="../images/nexttext_blue.gif" width="33" height="16" name="nexttext" alt="Next"></a></td>                <td><a href="jeremy2.html" onMouseOut="MM_swapImgRestore()" onMouseOver="MM_swapImage('document.next_arrow','document.next_arrow','/software/dreamweaver/designerspotlight/techniques/images/next_over.gif','#906526479980')"><img border="0" src="../images/next_up.gif" width="16" height="16" name="next_arrow" alt="Next"></a></td>              </tr>            </table>          </td>        </tr>      </table>  <TR>     <TD align=right vAlign=bottom width="10%"><A       href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/flash/buy/" target=_top><IMG       border=0 height=21 src="/images/buy.gif" width=67 alt="buy"></A><BR>      <A       href="/help/" target="_top"><IMG       border=0 height=21 src="/images/search.gif"     width=90 alt="search"></A><BR>    </TD>    <TD width="90%"><center>
