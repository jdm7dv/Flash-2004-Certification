<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Onion skin, is a feature 
  in Flash, that enables you to view or select multiple frames on several layers 
  in Flash. This is a useful feature, which often saves much time.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Note: Onion skins only appear 
  on layers that are NOT locked. Hold ALT and click on the layer icon if you're 
  in doubt.</font></p>
<p><img src="but.gif" width="107" height="26"></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These are the buttons that 
  enable / disable the use of onion skins.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Let's start with the first 
  button.</font></p>
<p><img src="1st.gif" width="269" height="216"></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As you can see, the first 
  button, enables you to see trails of the objects in an animation, in different 
  shades of the colors you use. Each of the shaded symbols in the trail, represent 
  that object at an earlier state in the animation. This means, the objects placement 
  on an earlier keyframe in the timeline. </font></p>
<p><img src="2nd.gif" width="236" height="238"></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The second button, shows 
  the shaded objects as outlines. As you can see, the symbols are still shaded, 
  only they are now outlines. Each symbol still represents that objects placement 
  in an earlier keyframe. Outline Onion Skins are less CPU Intensive.</font></p>
<p><img src="asm.gif" width="328" height="212"></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The third button, allows 
  you to select the visible symbols. This means, that you can select the first 
  and the last keyframe of an animation, and do whatever you want with it. This 
  allows you to make advanced operations, such as move the entire animation, instead 
  of moving the first, then the last keyframe of the animation. On the above image, 
  i've used a part of the intro for this site. Each letter has it's own layer. 
  Using the outline button, and the third button, i can select both the starting 
  and the ending keyframe for all the letters at once. This was useful, when i 
  should scale the letters to 200% trying to obtain the effect of the letters 
  &quot;falling down&quot;.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Learn this tip. It will 
  help you make more advanced animations than you'd ever dream of!</font></p>
