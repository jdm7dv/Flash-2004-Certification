<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Would you also like to create 
  a preloader, so that when the user enters your page, you can show him a tiny 
  animation or welcome text as the site loads? It's not so difficult. This is 
  how it's done:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Step 1.</b> Make a tiny 
  animation you want to show as the site loads, at the beginning of your Flash 
  movie.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Step 2.</b> At the last 
  keyframe of the animation, make a Goto command to the first frame of the animation.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now it loops.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Step 3.</b> Create a 
  keyframe between the preloader and your site contents. Dump everything you want 
  the preloader to load into this keyframe. Label it &quot;Preload&quot;.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This is what it means, and 
  why you should do it: &quot;If frame is loaded&quot; can only load one frame 
  (we labelled the frame &quot;preload&quot;). When this frame is loaded, Flash 
  will go on. Problem is, that YOU want to load the ENTIRE site, not just ONE 
  FRAME. Solution: If the library was loaded, then most of the site would be loaded 
  also, as all of your site uses what you have in your library... Therefore: &quot;Dump&quot; 
  everything from the library into ONE FRAME. Label this frame Preload, and tell 
  Flash to load THIS frame. Because when this frame is loaded, the entire library 
  is loaded!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I've been asked to explain 
  &quot;DUMP&quot;: I simply meant, you &quot;drag&quot; all of your symbols into 
  ONE keyframe in ONE layer. Open your library by pressing CTRL + L, and then 
  select the first symbol. With your left mousebutton, drag and drop the symbol 
  onto the stage, anywhere. It doesn't matter, as the movie will not show this 
  frame. It will only load it, and then skip it. Repeat this process for every 
  symbol in your library (moving onto the scene). Thereby, you have dumped everything 
  from your library to one keyframe. This is useful, because then you will only 
  have to preload ONE frame, to have your entire LIBRARY preloaded.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Step 3.</b> At the first 
  keyframe of the animation you created first, assign the action called &quot;If 
  frame is loaded&quot;. Now click &quot;Label&quot;, and choose the label of 
  the keyframe you just named &quot;Preload&quot;.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Step 4.</b> Immediately 
  after the &quot;If frame is loaded&quot; action, and before the &quot;End frame 
  loaded&quot;, enter a &quot;Goto&quot; command you your main site content.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">That's it!</font></p>
