Rotodesign Dingbats
 
Rotodesign Dingbats are an assortment of funny little illustrations borrowed, scanned and redrawn from old magazines and comic books. Now even the most important documents can have the look of crummy pulp magazines.

Rotodesign Dingbats are free. You can copy it, give it away, reverse-engineer it, whatever, so long as you include this readme file, and don't lie to your friends and tell 'em you made it yourself. You only cheat yourself if you do that. In the unlikely event you use this font to design something really cool or that makes you a ton of cash money, that's okay with me, just send me a copy or two, and remember me when you get rich and famous. Enjoy!
