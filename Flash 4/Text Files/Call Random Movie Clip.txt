Thanks Jessica and Byron for your responses!My project is a trivia game. I have 100 movie clip questions which I am calling randomly. I would like to avoid the same question coming up twice in a 60 second
round of play. thanks again Julie

I don't know how your movies are structured, but here is the basic logic:
SetVariables:
MovieCheck1 = 0, MovieCheck2 = 0, MovieCheck3 = 0, etc. until MovieCheck 100.

When a movie is loaded, set the corresponding MovieCheck# = 1. For example, question 5 was called, so MovieCheck5 = 1.

ChooseMovie = Random(100)+1
Loop While(Eval("MovieCheck" & ChooseMovie) = 1)
ChooseMovie = Random(100)+1
EndLoop

Then, Load Movie ("MovieCheck" & ChooseMovie)


What's Happening? - All the MovieCheck# variables are set to 0 at the beginning. This lets you know that none of the movies have been chosen. 

Everytime you choose a movie, you set its corresponding MovieCheck# to "1", which means that it's been used. When you randomly choose another movie, the loop will continue until you choose a movie whose MovieCheck# is still "0".
